## Core Concepts

*   **Decentralized:** Data is stored on the Autonomi decentralized storage network, not a centralized server. This means that no one can censor you, and you are in control of your own data, and it is accessible for anyone from anywhere. (If you wish so)
*   **Mutable:** Data can be updated and deleted, and the changes are persisted on the network.
*   **Key-Value Storage:** Offers a clean, asynchronous key-value interface (`get`, `put`, `rm`).
*   **Public/Private Uploads:** Store data publicly to share with others (no encryption) or store privately (encrypted with your private key).
*   **Resumable Uploads:** Automatic resume of interrupted uploads; pick up right where you left off.
*   **Configurable Upload Size:** Split the data into smaller or bigger chunks to optimize the upload speed and storage costs (default is 2MiB).
*   **Fetch History:** Keep track of the public data you've fetched to re-fetch it later.
*   **Efficient Space Reuse:** Frees and reuses storage pads, minimizing storage costs.
*   **Local Cache Index:** Fast local lookups and seamless remote synchronization.
*   **Sync:** Synchronize your local index with the remote storage.
*   **Recycling Bad Pads:** Automatically recycle bad pads to stay performant.
*   **Health Check:** Perform a health check on keys and reupload pads that give an error.
*   **Background Processing:** Run operations in the background with task management.
*   **Daemon Architecture:** Persistent daemon process handles network connections and operations.
*   **Task Management:** Monitor, query, and control background tasks.
*   **Async-first Design:** Built on `tokio` for high-performance non-blocking operations.
*   **Dual Interface:** Use as a Rust library (`mutant-lib`) or via the `mutant` CLI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Rust Toolchain (latest stable recommended)
*   `ant` CLI configured with a wallet (see below)

### Setup Rust Toolchain

This will install rustup

```bash
$> curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This will install the latest stable version of the Rust toolchain and cargo

```bash
$> rustup install nightly
```

### Setup `ant` Wallet

#### If you just want to fetch public data, you can skip this section.

Before using `mutant` to actually store data, you need to have an `ant` wallet configured for the target network (Mainnet by default, or Devnet if using the `--local` flag). If you don't have `ant` installed, you can get it using [antup](https://github.com/maidsafe/antup):

```bash
$> curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maidsafe/antup/main/install.sh | sh
```

This will install the `ant` CLI and configure it for the Mainnet.

```bash
$> antup client
```

Once `ant` is installed, if you haven't already, you can import your existing Ethereum/ANT wallet's private key using the `ant` CLI:

```bash
$> ant wallet import YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
```

Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE` with your actual private key. `mutant` will automatically detect and use this wallet.

Alternatively, you can create a new empty wallet using `ant wallet create` and fund it with the necessary ANT or ETH later.

MutAnt will look for your ant wallets and ask you which one you want to use if you have multiple on the first run, then save your choice in `~/.config/mutant/config.json`.

## Installation

```bash
$> cargo install mutant
```

## Quick start demo

You can fetch the daily meme of the day with the following command:

```bash
$> mutant get -p 80a9296e666d9f6d0dad8672e8a17fe15d00bae67e35ae4a471aabc2351ac85c4af654be0ea4c2ababf9a788b751ceac daily_meme.jpg
```

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

MutAnt includes the `mutant` command for convenient command-line access. When run without arguments, it defaults to listing your stored keys.

**CLI Usage Examples:**

```bash
$> mutant --help
```

```text

**Basic Usage:**

#### Store/fetch private data

```bash
# Store a file directly
$> mutant put mykey data.txt

# Get a value and save to a file
$> mutant get mykey fetched_data.txt

# Run operations in the background
$> mutant put my_file large_file.zip --background

# Remove a value
$> mutant rm mykey
```

#### Store/fetch public data

```bash
# Store data publicly (no encryption) under a name
$> mutant put -p my_key my_file.ext
1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

# Get your own public data by name
$> mutant get my_key output.txt

# Get public data by address
$> mutant get -p 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef output.txt

# You can update public data by using the same key
$> mutant put -p my_key my_updated_file.ext
```

# Perform health check on a specific key with recycling enabled
$> mutant health-check mykey --recycle
```


## Library Usage

Add `mutant-lib` and its dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
mutant-lib = "0.6.0" # Or the version you need
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

**Library Example:**

This example demonstrates initializing the necessary components and performing basic private store/fetch operations. It assumes you have an `ant` wallet setup.

```rust
use mutant_lib::{MutAnt, MutAntConfig, Error};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Replace with your actual private key (hex format, with or without 0x prefix)
    let private_key_hex = "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX";

    let mut mutant = MutAnt::init(private_key_hex).await?;

    mutant.put("greeting", b"hello world", StorageMode::Medium, false).await?;

    let fetched_value = mutant.get("greeting").await?;

    println!("Fetched value: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&fetched_value));

    mutant.rm("greeting").await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Fetching Public Data (Keyless Initialization)

If your application only needs to retrieve publicly stored data (using `store_public`) and doesn't need to manage private data, you can initialize a lightweight `MutAnt` instance without a private key using `MutAnt::init_public()`:

```rust
use mutant_lib::{MutAnt, Error};
use mutant_lib::storage::ScratchpadAddress;
use anyhow::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initialize a public fetcher instance (defaults to Mainnet)
    let public_fetcher = MutAnt::init_public().await?;

    // Assume you have the public address from elsewhere
    let address_hex = "..."; // Replace with actual public address hex
    let public_address = ScratchpadAddress::from_hex(address_hex)?;

    // Fetch the public data
    match public_fetcher.get_public(public_address).await {
        Ok(data) => println!("Fetched public data: {} bytes", data.len()),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to fetch public data: {}", e),
    }

    Ok(())
}

This keyless instance is optimized for fetching public data and cannot perform operations requiring a private key (like `put`, `rm`, `ls`, etc).

### Using the Daemon and Client

For most applications, it's recommended to use the daemon architecture:

```rust
use mutant_client::MutantClient;
use anyhow::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Connect to the daemon (must be running)
    let mut client = MutantClient::new();
    client.connect("ws://localhost:3030/ws").await?;

    // Start a put operation in the background
    let (start_task, progress_rx) = client.put(
        "my_key",
        "path/to/file.txt",
        mutant_protocol::StorageMode::Medium,
        false, // not public
        false, // verify
    ).await?;

    // Monitor progress (optional)
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        while let Ok(progress) = progress_rx.recv().await {
            println!("Progress: {:?}", progress);
        }
    });

    // Wait for the task to complete
    let result = start_task.await?;
    println!("Task completed: {:?}", result);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Development and Testing

### Local Testnet Management (`scripts/manage_local_testnet.sh`)

### Running Integration Tests (`scripts/run_tests_with_env.sh`)

## Migration

## Architecture Overview

MutAnt consists of five main components that work together to provide a complete storage solution:

1. **mutant-lib**: Core library handling chunking, encryption, and storage operations
2. **mutant-protocol**: Shared communication format definitions
3. **mutant-daemon**: Background service maintaining Autonomi connection
4. **mutant-client**: WebSocket client library for communicating with the daemon
5. **mutant-cli**: Command-line interface for end users

These components work together in a client-server architecture:

- The **daemon** uses **mutant-lib** to interact with the Autonomi network
- **Clients** (CLI or custom applications) connect to the daemon via WebSocket
- Communication between clients and the daemon uses the protocol definitions
- The daemon manages concurrent operations, background tasks, and network connections

This architecture provides several benefits:
- Persistent connection to the Autonomi network
- Background processing of long-running operations
- Task management and monitoring
- Concurrent operations with efficient resource usage
- Worker pools for optimized performance

### Internal Architecture

Under the hood, MutAnt uses a worker architecture for handling operations:
- 10 workers, each with a dedicated client
- Each worker manages 10 concurrent operations (tasks)
- Total of 100 concurrent operations
- Round-robin distribution of work with work stealing
- Automatic recycling of failed pads
