## Core Concepts

*   **Decentralized:** Data is stored on the Autonomi decentralized storage network, not a centralized server. This means that no one can censor you, and you are in control of your own data, and it is accessible for anyone from anywhere. (If you wish so)
*   **Mutable:** Data can be updated and deleted, and the changes are persisted on the network.
*   **Key-Value Storage:** Offers a clean, asynchronous key-value interface (`get`, `put`, `rm`).
*   **Public/Private Uploads:** Store data publicly to share with others (no encryption) or store privately (encrypted with your private key).
*   **Resumable Uploads:** Automatic resume of interrupted uploads; pick up right where you left off.
*   **Configurable Upload Size:** Split the data into smaller or bigger chunks to optimize the upload speed and storage costs (default is 2MiB).
*   **Fetch History:** Keep track of the public data you've fetched to re-fetch it later.
*   **Efficient Space Reuse:** Frees and reuses storage pads, minimizing storage costs.
*   **Local Cache Index:** Fast local lookups and seamless remote synchronization.
*   **Sync:** Synchronize your local index with the remote storage.
*   **Recycling Bad Pads:** Automatically recycle bad pads to stay performant.
*   **Health Check:** Perform a health check on keys and reupload pads that give an error.
*   **Background Processing:** Run operations in the background with task management.
*   **Daemon Architecture:** Persistent daemon process handles network connections and operations.
*   **Task Management:** Monitor, query, and control background tasks.
*   **Async-first Design:** Built on `tokio` for high-performance non-blocking operations.
*   **Dual Interface:** Use as a Rust library (`mutant-lib`) or via the `mutant` CLI.
*   **Web Interface**
       - Customizable windowed workspace 
       - Image viewer
       - Text/Code viewer/editor
       - Universal video format support with real-time transcoding and streaming with ffmpeg

## Installation

This is the all-in-one installation script that will install all dependencies, build the project, then run the daemon and the web interface.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Champii/Mutant/refs/heads/master/install.sh | bash
```

You will need to provide an Ethereum private key as well as an mnemonic phrase for the colony.  
While this script propose to generate both, this feature is currently broken. 

You need to generate both from [https://devtoolcafe.com/tools/bip39-generator](https://devtoolcafe.com/tools/bip39-generator) and give them to the script when asked.


## Quick start demo

You can fetch the daily meme of the day with the following command:

```bash
$> mutant get -p a420224971527d61ce6ee21d850a07c243498c95808697e8fac23f461545656933016697d10b805c0fa26b50eb3532b2 daily_meme.jpg
```

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)


<p align="center">

</p>


MutAnt includes the `mutant` command for convenient command-line access. When run without arguments, it defaults to listing your stored keys.

**CLI Usage Examples:**

```bash
$> mutant --help
```

```text

**Basic Usage:**

#### Store/fetch private data

```bash
# Store a the file `data.txt` under the name `mykey`
$> mutant put mykey data.txt

# Get a value and save to a file
$> mutant get mykey fetched_data.txt

# Run operations in the background
$> mutant put my_file large_file.zip --background

# Remove a value
$> mutant rm mykey
```

#### Store/fetch public data

```bash
# Store data publicly (no encryption) under a name
$> mutant put -p my_key my_file.ext
1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

# Get your own public data by name
$> mutant get my_key output.txt

# Get public data by address
$> mutant get -p 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef output.txt

# You can update public data by using the same key
$> mutant put -p my_key my_updated_file.ext
```

#### Daemon and task management

```bash
# Start the daemon (happens automatically when needed)
$> mutant daemon start

# Check daemon status
$> mutant daemon status

# List background tasks
$> mutant tasks list

# Get details of a specific task
$> mutant tasks get <task_id>

# Stop a running task
$> mutant tasks stop <task_id>
```

#### Stats and management

```bash
# List stored keys
$> mutant ls

## Library Usage

Add `mutant-lib` and its dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
mutant-lib = "0.6.2" # Or the version you need
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

**Library Example:**

This example demonstrates initializing the necessary components and performing basic private store/fetch operations. It assumes you have an `ant` wallet setup.

```rust
use mutant_lib::{MutAnt, MutAntConfig, Error};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Replace with your actual private key (hex format, with or without 0x prefix)
    let private_key_hex = "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX";

    let mut mutant = MutAnt::init(private_key_hex).await?;

    mutant.put("greeting", b"hello world", StorageMode::Medium, false).await?;

    let fetched_value = mutant.get("greeting").await?;
    println!("Fetched value: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&fetched_value));

    mutant.rm("greeting").await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Fetching Public Data (Keyless Initialization)

If your application only needs to retrieve publicly stored data (using `store_public`) and doesn't need to manage private data, you can initialize a lightweight `MutAnt` instance without a private key using `MutAnt::init_public()`:

```rust
use mutant_lib::{MutAnt, Error};
use mutant_lib::storage::ScratchpadAddress;
use anyhow::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initialize a public fetcher instance (defaults to Mainnet)
    let public_fetcher = MutAnt::init_public().await?;

    // Assume you have the public address from elsewhere
    let address_hex = "..."; // Replace with actual public address hex
    let public_address = ScratchpadAddress::from_hex(address_hex)?;

    // Fetch the public data
    match public_fetcher.get_public(public_address).await {
        Ok(data) => println!("Fetched public data: {} bytes", data.len()),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to fetch public data: {}", e),
    }

    Ok(())
}

This keyless instance is optimized for fetching public data and cannot perform operations requiring a private key (like `put`, `rm`, `ls`, etc).

### Using the Daemon and Client

For most applications, it's recommended to use the daemon architecture:

```rust
use mutant_client::MutantClient;
use anyhow::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Connect to the daemon (must be running)
    let mut client = MutantClient::new();
    client.connect("ws://localhost:3001/ws").await?;

    // Start a put operation in the background
    let (start_task, progress_rx) = client.put(
        "my_key",
        "path/to/file.txt",
        mutant_protocol::StorageMode::Medium,
        false, // not public
        false, // verify
    ).await?;

    // Monitor progress (optional)
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        while let Ok(progress) = progress_rx.recv().await {
            println!("Progress: {:?}", progress);
        }
    });

    // Wait for the task to complete
    let result = start_task.await?;
    println!("Task completed: {:?}", result);

    Ok(())
}
```
